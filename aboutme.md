Hi there! This is Shengcao Cao, a first-year M.S. in **robotics** student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, advised by [Prof. Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in **computer science** at **Peking University**, advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of **machine learning** and **computer vision**. In particular, I have been studying the topics of deep reinforcement learning, neural architecture search, adversarial examples, graph neural networks, etc.
