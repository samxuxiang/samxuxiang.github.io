I am proudly made in Chengdu, China, which is also the hometown of pandas. Chengdu is definitely a lovely city for your next vacation!

I can speak/use the following languages: 中文, English, 日本語, Python, C, LaTeX, etc.

I love music of diverse genres, from Jay Chou to Post-rock. I also play the guitar a little bit - mainly fingerstyle.

I love exploring gourmet food around the world (see my Instagram). I enjoy reproducing cuisines of all sorts, possibly because I come from Sichuan province.

I have been playing Blizzard games a lot, mostly StarCraft & Overwatch. Find me out!
